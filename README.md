# Pocket Guardians

Pocket Guardians is a single-player mobile game that helps commuters kill boredom during their travels. Very often, commuters are often playing games, watching shows or browsing social media sites on their mobile devices during commute. Hence, our team would like to create a innovative new game to target these commuters. In addition, our team has devoted ourselves to cultivate an environment that stimulates thinking on the go. Pocket Guardian is a fun-filled action game that eliminates boredom by delivering an endless hours of exciting gameplay to commuters. It encompasses the basic requirements of a game that engages passengers on a simple and intuitive level. Say goodbye to boring tutorials and conventional gameplay! :grin:

Our inspirations were obtain from popular games such as Plants Vs. Zombies, Angry Birds, Candy Crush Saga, Clash Royale, etc. Some features we hope to include are:

1. **Social Media Integration** which allows players to share their progress with their friends on a competitive scale
2. **Customisable Game Skins** where players can customize their characters
3. **User Data Management** where players can download and upload their game data for portability

_This game is suitable for user age 9 and above._

_[Disclaimer: Objects and their designs are subjected to changes from version to version, hence they may not be finalised yet and are a rough implementation of the final product.]_

### **Milestone 1** 

**Deliverables**:

1. README - This documentation is the readme
2. Project Log: Access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCo749g4-QwL-TzHND1M7yVN06aqQtc5tcn_mW-Oyqo/edit?usp=sharing)

By Milestone 1, we aim to have an overall idea/design we want to achieve for our game and what tools we should use for making our game. For example, should we use Unity or Android Studio? What game art, skins, sprites and audio to use. Have a rough sketch of our splash screen, menu and game stages to guide us along. As well as what extra features we would like for our game. We also aim to complete some of the basic CRUD capabilities for our game so that we can spend more time on developing the extra features in Milestone 2.

We started off by experimenting using the Android Studio to create a mobile game. However, we wanted to allow our game to be played on not just Android but also iOS. Hence, we switched over to using Unity because of its multi-platform support, and Visual Studio for Unity's scripting process. In addition, Unity provides greater support as it already comes with a suite of developmental tools for creating graphic, sound, animation assets. 

We proceeded to do some initial planning by coming up with some user stories categorised as Must Have, Good To Have and Maybe. (See User Stories section below.)

For the development of the game, we decided that Leslie will be in charge of designing the game environment and gameplay, while Jia Xuan will be handling the implementation of the extra features to be included into the game such as the Social Media Integration, and also the administrative matters of this project.

### **Milestone 2** 

**Deliverables**:

1. Project Log: Access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCo749g4-QwL-TzHND1M7yVN06aqQtc5tcn_mW-Oyqo/edit?usp=sharing)

By Milestone 2, we hope to have a fully working prototype of our game, with the basic CRUD features completed. We also plan to add in the planned features such as Social Media Integration, User Data Management and Customisable Game Skins into our game in this respective order. By Milestone 2, we hope to finalise more or less every aspect of the game without any additional major changes.

Currently, we have a working prototype of our game with the basic CRUD features. (Create a new game, load a saved game, save game progress and delete a saved game.)

We also have implemented the extra feature: Social Media Integration, where players can share, invite and check out their rankings against their friends.

### **Milestone 3** 

By Milestone 3, in the event that we are not able to add in the Customisable Game Skins feature in time, we hope to set aside some buffer time in this milestone, just in case.

By Milestone 3, we hope to have tested our game with volunteers to gather more feedbacks. We also hope to further polish up any areas within the game, such as, increasing the number of levels/stages for our game if necessary, or improving the visuals within the game.
