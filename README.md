# Pocket Guardians

Pocket Guardians is a single-player mobile game that aims to help people who spend time travelling to work, school, or back home, to kill their boredom during their commute. It encompasses the basic requirements for a game to be engaging through simple, intuitive gameplay. This means there is no tutorial or help needed to start playing the game!

We drew our inspirations for Pocket Guardians from popular games such as Plants Vs Zombies, Angry Birds, Candy Crush and Clash Royale. Some features we would like to have are, **Social Media Integration** so that players can share their progress with their friends about the game, **Customisable Game Skins** so players can personalise the game, **User Data Management** so players can download and upload their game data for portability.

_[Disclaimer: Objects and their designs are subjected to changes from version to version, hence they may not be finalised yet and are a rough implementation of the final product.]_

##**Milestone 1** 

**Deliverables**:

1. README - This documentation is the readme
2. Project Log: Access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCo749g4-QwL-TzHND1M7yVN06aqQtc5tcn_mW-Oyqo/edit#gid=0)

By Milestone 1, we aim to have a general prototype of our project, a working game interface but not including game visuals and graphics. We also aim to have an overall idea/design we want to achieve for our game, for example what extra features we would like for our game.

We started of by experimenting using the Android Studio to create a mobile game. However, we decided to allow our game to be played on not just Android but also iOS. Hence, we switched over to using Unity because of its multi-platform support, and Visual Studio for Unity's scripting process.

We proceeded to do some initial planning by coming up with some user stories categorised as Must Have, Good To Have and Maybe. (See below under User Stories section)

For the development of the game, we decided that Leslie will be in charge of designing the game environment and gameplay, while Jia Xuan will be handling the implementation of the extra features to be included into the game such as the Social Media Integration, and also the administrative matters of our project.

##**Milestone 2** 

By Milestone 2, we hope that our game will be fully working and playable with all visuals and graphics added in. We also hope to add in some planned features such as Social Media Integration, Customisable Game Skins, and User Data Management. By Milestone 2, we hope to finalise more or less every aspect of the game without any additional major changes.

##**Milestone 3** 

By Milestone 3, we hope to have tested our game with volunteers to gather more feedbacks. We also hope to increase the number of levels/stages for our game if necessary.
