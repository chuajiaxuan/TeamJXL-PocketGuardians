# Pocket Guardians

Pocket Guardians is a single-player mobile game that helps commuters kill boredom during their travels. Very often, commuters are either seen dozing off in public transports or simply staring blankly into the remote space. To alleviate these problems, our team has devoted ourselves to cultivate an environment that stimulates thinking on the go. Pocket Guardian is a fun-filled action game that eliminates boredom by delivering an endless hours of exciting gameplay to commuters. It encompasses the basic requirements of a game that engages passengers on a simple and intuitive level. Say goodbye to boring tutorials and conventional gameplay! :grin:

Our inspirations were obtain from popular games such as Plants Vs. Zombies, Angry Birds, Candy Crush Saga, Clash Royale, etc. Some features includes:

1. **Social Media Integration** which allows players to share their progress with their friends on a competitive scale
2. **Customisable Game Skins** where players can customize their characters
3. **User Data Management** where players can download and upload their game data for portability

_[This game is suitable for user age 9 and above.]_

_[Disclaimer: Objects and their designs are subjected to changes from version to version, hence they may not be finalised yet and are a rough implementation of the final product.]_

### **Milestone 1** 

**Deliverables**:

1. README - This documentation is the readme
2. Project Log: Access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCo749g4-QwL-TzHND1M7yVN06aqQtc5tcn_mW-Oyqo/edit?usp=sharing)

By Milestone 1, we aim to have a general prototype of our project, a working game interface but not including game visuals and graphics. We also aim to have an overall idea/design we want to achieve for our game, for example what extra features we would like for our game.

We started of by experimenting using the Android Studio to create a mobile game. However, we decided to allow our game to be played on not just Android but also iOS. Hence, we switched over to using Unity because of its multi-platform support, and Visual Studio for Unity's scripting process.

We proceeded to do some initial planning by coming up with some user stories categorised as Must Have, Good To Have and Maybe. (See below under User Stories section)

For the development of the game, we decided that Leslie will be in charge of designing the game environment and gameplay, while Jia Xuan will be handling the implementation of the extra features to be included into the game such as the Social Media Integration, and also the administrative matters of our project.

### **Milestone 2** 

By Milestone 2, we hope that our game will be fully working and playable with all visuals and graphics added in. We also hope to add in some planned features such as Social Media Integration, Customisable Game Skins, and User Data Management. By Milestone 2, we hope to finalise more or less every aspect of the game without any additional major changes.

### **Milestone 3** 

By Milestone 3, we hope to have tested our game with volunteers to gather more feedbacks. We also hope to increase the number of levels/stages for our game if necessary.
